This is where I will keep track of the timing at the various stages. 

5-min implementation
---------------------
Evaluates Gaussian on 80 threads. 
Memcpy: 200ms. 
kernel: 4us. 
This is obviously a very inefficient use of resources. 


Next up: calculate chi2 of test gaussian params, compared to reference distribution. 
---------------------
Each thread evaluate chi2 of gaussian - data point, summed over 30*30 data points (note, all data is nonsense). 
memcp: 130ms
kernel :1.3ms. 
still, obviously way inefficient.
